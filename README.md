## Description

This project was an idea that came to my mind in previous years, and I was inspired by knowing it had been done before. I couldn't create it at the time because I didn't know how to code, but now I've started working on the project. I tried to bring you nostalgia by using the old Windows 95 theme on my personal webpage. With changeable backgrounds, about me and experience features, I'm here with you with a fun, simple and minimalist project.

## How to Run

You can run the project using Python's built-in server or other alternatives:

```bash
python -m http.server 5000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Alternative Methods

- Use any other local server solution
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser
- Use VS Code Live Server extension
